# üß¨ Pok√©mon Gen 1 Visual Analysis in 

This project explores Generation 1 Pok√©mon through the lens of data science and visual storytelling. By leveraging the Kaggle Pok√©mon dataset and R-based visualization libraries, the analysis delves into type distributions, base stats, evolutionary progressions, and legendary status comparisons ‚Äî culminating in an academic poster titled **"Exploring the World of Pok√©mon: Insights from Gen 1"**.

## üìÇ Project Overview

This project focuses on:
- Understanding **type distributions** among Gen 1 Pok√©mon
- Analyzing **base stat progression** through evolutionary lines (e.g., Bulbasaur, Charmander)
- Highlighting **battle strength** through attack-focused box plots
- Comparing **catch rates** across iconic species
- Visualizing **abilities** using circular packing plots
